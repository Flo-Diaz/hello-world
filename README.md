Hi everyone !

My name is Flo, i'm a 32 years old Transgender, Non-bInary Web designer Trainee, studying at the AFPA St JÃ©rome, Marseille, France.
I'v gathered my skills as a autodidact from various job, mission and personal hobby i'v done over time and now i'm relearning everything from bases to earn my diploma.

So here i am.
